description: >-
  The Catalan Integral Cooperative (CIC) is a network of co-ops in the Catalonia region of Spain that aims – explicitly – to build a decentralized, post-capitalist economy based on cooperative ownership (of housing, of businesses, of distribution networks, etc.) that can fully satisfy the needs of everyone in the region without dependence on a broader capitalist system.
